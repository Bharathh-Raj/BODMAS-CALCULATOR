# PYTHON CALCULATOR applying BODMAS rule
Hello world,
First of all i need to clarify that these codes are written just for practice..So,here i don't use any Python libraries.
Also these codes are not written with Time Complexity in mind.

If you get any error in the code,please let me know.Thanks

Let's get into it

AS i mentioned in the description,This program gets input as a string,divides them according to the operation.

It can do calculations involving "("  ,  ")"  ,  "/"  ,  "*"  ,  "+"  ,  "-" 

Then by BODMAS rule,it first calculates the innermost parantheses(),and accordingly to the outermost.

First does Bracket operation

then Division

then Multiplication

then Addition

then Subtraction

Finally gives the solution.

eg:If you give input as -35-62.003(-35.1+63(-3*-5.32)5*0)(-5/-2)+235-62(35.33+63.1(3*5)5)(5.54) ,Provides -1632483.48515 as output

   If you give input as 5/0 , provides "Can't divide by zero" as output 
   
 Thanks.
